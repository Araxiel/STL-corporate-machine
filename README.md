# Corporate Machine

> [!NOTE]
> **26/09/24**: This was an early attempt to add some kind of megacorporations that have some influence on your empire. This was a while before "megacorporations" got introduced into the game. However in hindsight the megacorporations that got introduced are an empire type unto itself, instead of representing actors within an empire. Amusingly, like a few aspects of Stellaris (pops, strata, etc.) that overlap with Victoria 2 and 3, what I planned on introduce with this mod back in 2017 is similar to what has been introduced to Victoria 3 with companies and, as of the time of writing this note, will be expanded upon in update 1.8.
